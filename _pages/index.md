Living like a hydra is a weird, unscientific, but hopefully deeply relevant and useful way of living life. It can be thought of as a footnote to this (most likely misattributed) quote from Viktor Frankl:

> Between stimulus and response is a space.
> 
> In that space is our power to choose our response.
> 
> In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

To "live like a hydra" is to practice being wholehearted and "in flow" in that space between stimulus and response, and to do so within whatever constraints and at whatever energy level we are with in the moment. It is about slowly accepting and then learning to love the wily chaos monkey's unending lobbing of chaos bananas that knock us off our feet at random frequencies, and ultimately finding ways to grow wiser, more courageous, and more loving as the chaos monkey's lifelong dance partner. I wrote [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89?source=friends_link&sk=9aa3e637cb424bfe3a775a47ab740150){:target="blank"} seven years ago and have returned to it frequently enough (chaotic times are here to stay, apparently) to want to update it with an updated set of "modes" or "hydra heads" to wear in the world. 

### 3 dimensions or ways to make contact with reality

When it comes to making sense of our lives and the world we live in, there are three broad categories of things that a meaningful life requires:  

1. **Blue Dimension - Connection to the World:** Connection to the world outside ourselves. When we feel in connection with the frontier of the world, we feel _certainty_ about reality. When we're don't, we feel like everything is _absurd_. 
	- üß† The realm of the head and measurable information.
	- üåé Connection to the World is the realm of pushing further into the unknown universe. 
	- üìì Its tools are science, and data, and log books, and experiments. 
	- üêê In Venkatesh's model, this is the Frontier, also known as Goatspace because you can find goats improbably climbing sheer cliffs at the frontiers. 
	- üíé We will also represent it with the color Blue, one of the 3 primary colors.

2. **Red Dimension - Connection to Ourself:** When we feel in connection with our own intuitions and feelings and our heart and home, we feel a like we are _accepted and safe_. When we're not, we feel extremely _anxious_. 
	- ‚ù§Ô∏è The realm of the heart and personal experience.
	- üëÄ Connection to Ourself is the realm of pushing further into the experience of sensing and being. 
	- üîÆ Its tools are story-telling, mindfulness, intuition, beliefs, and values. 
	- üêÄ In Venkatesh's model, this is the Home, also known as Ratspace because no matter how well you know your own home, rats probably know it better. 
	- üéà We will also represent it with the color Red, one of the 3 primary colors. 

3. **Yellow Dimension - Connection to Community:** Connection to other people in the world like us. When we feel in connection with the public social realm, we feel like we are _useful and seen_. When we're not, we feel _alienated and lost_. 
	- ‚úã The realm of the hands and useful pragmatism.
	- üí¨ Connection to Community is the realm of pushing further into the the messiness of communication, feedback loops, and the experience of doing. 
	- ü§ù Its tools are relationships, social contracts, cultural norms, and expectations.
	- üê¶ In Venkatesh's model, this is the Public, also known as Crowspace because the crow can fly from your windowsill to any other windowsill in your community disregarding all the social friction we must deal with.	
	- ‚≠êÔ∏è We will also represent it with the color Yellow, one of the 3 primary colors.

These 3 ways of making contact with reality appear in so many different places, and are more a complicated network of connections than a singular connection, hence why I've included a bunch of different metaphors in each bucket. They function in the same way that the directions on a compass function on a map -- they point towards a certain dimension of our experience of reality that can be referenced from wherever we are within that experience. You'll probably discover many other facets of these 3 dimensions, feel free to associate your own preferred metaphors for them. 

You can think of each of the following modes as a way of being that comes about based on how many of these three dimensions we currently feel in meaningful contact with. 

### 8 hydra heads

Everything in the universe goes through cycles. Cycles of high energy and low energy. Cycles of change and stability. Cycles of focus and distraction. We‚Äôre no different, but most of the time we are trying to force fit ourselves into a mode that we aren‚Äôt in, and that causes trouble. This isn't a complete list, it's just marking the major "colors" of an infinite spectrum spectrum of modes.

1. **Gray's Cat Mode:** Back-to-basics recovery. All 3 dimensions (Blue, Red, and Yellow) are offline for us. This is the mode where we are burned out, tired, over-stimulated, under-nourished, and basically useless. This Chaos Monkey has hit us and we are down. The goal of this mode is to get any one of the dimensions back online, usually by focusing on the basics: sleep, water, sunshine, vegetables, exercise, stretching, meditation, nature, comfort of friends, walks, and good books and other entertainment. Trying to be productive is pointless. Productivity happens in other modes‚Ä¶ so work on moving out of this mode, slowly, patiently, without beating yourself up. Channel the all-in "do nothing" mode that a cat napping on a window sill is able to do. Entire days can be written off. Rest and recovery will only happen when we stop thinking of the world as a place to get shit done. When emerging from this mode, consider Blue's Novelty Mode, Yellow's Make It Happen Mode, and Red's Self mode as likely next steps.

2. **Blue's Novelty Mode:** Seek novelty, exploration, and stimulus. The Blue dimension is online, but Red and Yellow are offline. This mode is all about connecting with the outside world. It has a slightly higher energy level than Gray's Cat Mode but not quite enough energy to focus on a specific task. The key here is to channel the desire for distraction into seeking novelty. Meeting new people, trying new restaurants, going new places, learning about something new. It‚Äôs also a great place to think about the people that are important to you, reaching out to important people that you haven‚Äôt connected with in a while, restarting hobbies that have fallen by the wayside, and revisiting things that you don‚Äôt like to see if maybe there‚Äôs something new there that changes things. The way out of this mode is to consider Green's Reality-Seeking Mode if you are able to bring Yellow back online by establishing contact with community or Purple's Creation Mode if you are able to bring Red back online by establishing contact with yourself. If neither of those is possible, it may be necessary to step back into Gray's Cat Mode to shore up some new energy.

3. **Yellow's Make It Happen Mode:** Immerse yourself in busy work. The Yellow dimension is online, but Blue and Red are offline. This mode is all about connecting deeply with your community. It requires the same energy level as Blue's Novelty Mode but is handy when there‚Äôs a big backlog of things that need to get done that have been weighing on you. Things that don‚Äôt require much creativity or thought to do, but which just need to be banged out. Fixing things, cleaning things, maintaining things, organizing things, etc. When done in the right mode, this kind of slogging work can actually be very satisfying.

4. **Red's Self Mode:** Self-reflect and identify beliefs and values. The Red dimension is online, but Blue and Yellow are offline. This mode is all about connecting deeply with yourself. Making sure that you know what your needs are, and are able to take the steps to make sure that they‚Äôre met. This mode benefits from the progress of having your basics covered (sleep, nutrition, exercise) as well as having some outlet for the crazy energy that can only be taken care of by exploration and grunt work. Once in this mode, you‚Äôre ready to calm down, think about your values and beliefs, think about your interests and important people, and make decisions that are in your best long-term interest even if they‚Äôre difficult in the short term. Get your own head screwed on right.

5. **Green's Reality-Seeking Mode:** Discover a new artifact of what's really real. The Blue and Yellow dimensions are online, but Red is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with the world and with the community. 

6. **Purple's Creation Mode:** Make something that feels true to life. The Blue and Red dimensions are online, but Yellow is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with the world and with yourself. 

7. **Orange's Relating Mode:** Cultivate authentic, quality time with others. The Yellow and Red dimensions are online, but Blue is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with yourself and with the community. Quality time with people you love is probably the most rewarding experience we can have on this planet. The list is short of people that fit this category, and these are the people that are most easy to take for granted. Also, some relationships might need repair or re-connection before quality time is possible. Being in this mode is all about doing the work that sets you up for quality time, and making sure you have a chance to connect in a real way with the people that mean the most to you, as often as possible, while we can. Life is long, but not forever long.

8. **Gold's Hydra Mode:** An honest, fluid, connection with yourself, the world, and others. All 3 dimensions (Blue, Red, and Yellow) are online.

The key thing to take away is that none of these heads or modes are better than the others. They are each adapted to help us thrive within a certain flavor of chaos, and are vulnerable to other flavors. A way to think about them that is new since the first article was written is that I believe there's a way to see these 8 modes as a system that is MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) system that accounts for each corner of life's messiness at a certain level of resolution. Inspired by Venkatesh Rao's epic post about life rule systems titled [Make Your Own Rules](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/){:target="blank"}, I've adapted his "mind-wanderer's map", complete with animal mneumonic markers, along with a few other things that feel relevant in a weird way.

### 6 systems within the thinking fractal

And finally, there's the [thinking fractal](https://medium.com/@buster/the-marvelous-thinking-fractal-that-is-us-2aaafd35ba93?source=friends_link&sk=be801a3a0ddde19e062edb32aa1eea0f){:target="blank"} that I have been obsessed about. Within each of the 3 ways to see the world, and the 8 hydra heads that attempt to fit you to the world, there are multiple levels of resolution that you can see that world at. Roughly speaking, they are: 

1. **System 1:** Intuitions
2. **System 2:** Individuals
3. **System 3:** Teams
4. **System 4:** Communities
5. **System 5:** Cultures
6. **System 6:** The Natural World

Each of these systems has a public, a frontier, and a sense of home. Each of these systems can also be in one of the 8 modes that function as mechanisms to identify what is relevant in the moment. 

### 144 ways of the hydra

Here's a bit more about each of the modes, in light of the ways to see the world:

#### Cat Mode: back-to-basics recovery

#### Novelty Mode: seek novelty, exploration, and stimulus

#### Make It Happen Mode: immerse yourself in mindless work

#### Self Mode: self-reflect and identify beliefs and values

#### Truth-Seeking Mode: find the source of what's real

#### Creation Mode: make something important

#### Relating Mode: cultivate quality time with others

#### Hydra Mode: nebulous connection yourself, the world, and others
