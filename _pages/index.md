title: Live Like a Hydra

Living like a hydra is a weird, unscientific, but hopefully deeply relevant and useful way of living life. It can be thought of as a footnote to this (most likely misattributed) quote from Viktor Frankl:

> Between stimulus and response is a space.
> 
> In that space is our power to choose our response.
> 
> In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

To "live like a hydra" is to practice being wholehearted and "in flow" in that space between stimulus and response, and to do so within whatever constraints and at whatever energy level we are with in the moment. It is about slowly accepting and then learning to love the wily chaos monkey's unending lobbing of chaos bananas that knock us off our feet at random frequencies, and ultimately finding ways to grow wiser, more courageous, and more loving as the chaos monkey's lifelong dance partner. I wrote [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89?source=friends_link&sk=9aa3e637cb424bfe3a775a47ab740150){:target="blank"} seven years ago and have returned to it frequently enough (chaotic times are here to stay, apparently) to want to update it with an updated set of "modes" or "hydra heads" to wear in the world. 

## 3 ways to make contact with reality

When it comes to making sense of our lives and the world we live in, there are three broad dimensions that a meaningful life requires contact with:  

1. **Blue Dimension - Connection to the World:** Connection to the world outside ourselves. When we feel in connection with the frontier of the world, we feel _certainty_ about reality. When we don't feel connected to the world, we feel like everything is _absurd_. 
	- 🧠 The realm of the head and measurable information.
	- 🌎 Connection to the World is the realm of pushing further into the unknown universe. 
	- 📓 Its tools are science, and data, and log books, and experiments. 
	- 🐐 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Frontier, also known as Goatspace because you can find goats improbably climbing sheer cliffs at the frontiers. 
	- 💎 We will also represent it with the color Blue, one of the 3 primary colors.

2. **Red Dimension - Connection to Ourself:** When we feel in connection with our own intuitions and feelings and our heart and home base, we feel like we are _accepted and safe_. When we're don't feel connected to our true selves, we feel extremely _anxious and uncentered_. 
	- ❤️ The realm of the heart and personal experience.
	- 👀 Connection to Ourself is the realm of pushing further into the experience of sensing and being. 
	- 🔮 Its tools are story-telling, mindfulness, intuition, beliefs, and values. 
	- 🐀 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Home, also known as Ratspace because no matter how well you know your own home, rats probably know it better. 
	- 🎈 We will also represent it with the color Red, one of the 3 primary colors. 

3. **Yellow Dimension - Connection to Community:** Connection to other people in the world like us. When we feel in connection with the public social realm, we feel like we are _useful and seen_. When we're don't feel connected to our community, we feel _alienated and invisible_. 
	- ✋ The realm of the hands and useful pragmatism.
	- 💬 Connection to Community is the realm of pushing further into the the messiness of communication, feedback loops, and the experience of doing. 
	- 🤝 Its tools are relationships, social contracts, cultural norms, and expectations.
	- 🐦 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Public, also known as Crowspace because the crow can fly from your windowsill to any other windowsill in your community disregarding all the social friction we must deal with.	
	- ⭐️ We will also represent it with the color Yellow, one of the 3 primary colors.

These 3 ways of making contact with reality appear in so many different places, and are more a complicated network of connections than a singular connection, hence why I've included a bunch of different metaphors in each bucket. They function in the same way that the directions on a compass function on a map -- they point towards a certain dimension of our experience of reality that can be referenced from wherever we are within that experience. You'll probably discover many other facets of these 3 dimensions, feel free to associate your own preferred metaphors for them. 

You can think of each of the following modes as a way of being that comes about based on how many of these three dimensions we currently feel in meaningful contact with. 
 
## 8 hydra heads for 8 modes 

We go in and out of contact with the three dimensions of the World, Ourselves, and Community. Our "mode" of existence can be understood by how close we feel to each of these dimensions at any given time. Sometimes we're connected to all three dimensions, and in flow. Other times we're only connected to two out of three, or one out of three. And sometimes we're out of touch with all three dimensions. All told, there are 8 high-level modes that result from this interplay of connections. Keep in mind that it's more of a spectrum than a color wheel, but the color wheel can at least identify some of the biggest landmarks along the spectrum. They are color-coded to map back to the 3 dimensions that they are in relation to: 

1. Gray (Cat Mode)
2. Blue (Novelty Mode)
3. Yellow (Make It Happen Mode)
4. Red (Self Mode)
5. Green (Reality-Seeking Mode)
6. Purple (Creation Mode)
7. Orange (Relating Mode)
8. Gold (Flow Mode)

### Which mode are you in right now?

You can quickly figure out which mode you're in right now by asking yourself these three Y/N questions.

**3 questions:** In this moment...

1. Does your immediate environment feel A) more grounded and reliable or B) more disorganized and absurd?
2. Do you feel A) more in touch with your intuitions and authentic self or B) more out-of-touch and uncentered?
3. Do you feel A) more useful and appreciated by your immediate social circle or B) more alienated and invisible?

**Answer key:** N and Y represent answers to the 3 questions above. 
>   
> BBB = Gray. AAA = Gold.  
> ABB = Blue. BAB = Red. BBA = Yellow.  
> AAB = Purple. BAA = Orange. ABA = Green. 

### What does each mode feel like?

1. **Gray (Cat Mode):** Put everything else aside and focus on yourself for a bit. Get back to basics. All 3 dimensions (Blue, Red, and Yellow) are offline for us. This is the mode where we are burned out, tired, over-stimulated, under-nourished, and basically useless. We feel like the world is absurd, uncentered in our own identity, and mostly invisible to our social safety nets. The goal of this mode is to get any one of the dimensions back online, usually by focusing on the basics. Trying to be productive is pointless. Productivity happens in other modes -- work must focus on moving out of this mode, slowly, patiently, without beating yourself up. 

	- When dropping down into Gray from any other mode: Channel the all-in "do nothing" mode that a cat napping on a window sill is able to do. Entire days can be written off. Rest and recovery will only happen when we stop thinking of the world as a place to get shit done. 

	- When spending time in Gray: Is there anything preventing you from reverting to full-on Cat Mode? Most likely the circumstances that landed you here didn't just magically disappear, so this is completely natural. Is there any wiggle room to sneak in some serious self-care?  

	- To move up from Gray to Blue: If it's a nice day, get out into the world. Take a walk. Find some nature if you can. Listen to a book or watch a movie. Entertain yourself with a guilty pleasure.

	- To move up from Gray to Yellow: Catch up with an old friend, call up your best friend, write someone a letter, have a good conversation about nothing in particular. 

	- To move up from Gray to Red: Attend to what your body is telling you it needs. Sleep, water, vegetables, exercise, stretching, meditation, etc.

2. **Blue (Novelty Mode):** Appreciating novelty, exploration, and stimulus. The Blue dimension is online, but Red and Yellow are offline. This mode is all about connecting with the outside world. It has a slightly higher energy level than Gray's Cat Mode but not quite enough energy to focus on a specific task. The key here is to channel the desire for distraction into seeking novelty. Meeting new people, trying new restaurants, going new places, learning about something new. It’s also a great place to think about the people that are important to you, reaching out to important people that you haven’t connected with in a while, restarting hobbies that have fallen by the wayside, and revisiting things that you don’t like to see if maybe there’s something new there that changes things. The way out of this mode is to consider Green's Reality-Seeking Mode if you are able to bring Yellow back online by establishing contact with community or Purple's Creation Mode if you are able to bring Red back online by establishing contact with yourself. If neither of those is possible, it may be necessary to step back into Gray's Cat Mode to shore up some new energy.

3. **Yellow (Make It Happen Mode):** Immersing yourself in busy work. The Yellow dimension is online, but Blue and Red are offline. This mode is all about connecting deeply with your community. It requires the same energy level as Blue's Novelty Mode but is handy when there’s a big backlog of things that need to get done that have been weighing on you. Things that don’t require much creativity or thought to do, but which just need to be banged out. Fixing things, cleaning things, maintaining things, organizing things, etc. When done in the right mode, this kind of slogging work can actually be very satisfying.

4. **Red (Self Mode):** Self-reflecting and identifying beliefs and values. The Red dimension is online, but Blue and Yellow are offline. This mode is all about connecting deeply with yourself. Making sure that you know what your needs are, and are able to take the steps to make sure that they’re met. This mode benefits from the progress of having your basics covered (sleep, nutrition, exercise) as well as having some outlet for the crazy energy that can only be taken care of by exploration and grunt work. Once in this mode, you’re ready to calm down, think about your values and beliefs, think about your interests and important people, and make decisions that are in your best long-term interest even if they’re difficult in the short term. Get your own head screwed on right.

7. **Orange (Relating Mode):** Cultivating authentic, quality time with others. The Yellow and Red dimensions are online, but Blue is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with yourself and with the community. Quality time with people you love is probably the most rewarding experience we can have on this planet. The list is short of people that fit this category, and these are the people that are most easy to take for granted. Also, some relationships might need repair or re-connection before quality time is possible. Being in this mode is all about doing the work that sets you up for quality time, and making sure you have a chance to connect in a real way with the people that mean the most to you, as often as possible, while we can. Life is long, but not forever long.

	- When moving up from Purple to Gold: 

	- When moving up from Orange to Gold:

An important thing to remember is that none of these heads or modes are better than the others. They are each adapted to help us thrive within a certain flavor of chaos, require different levels of energy and support, and are vulnerable different kinds of chaos. A way to think about them that is new since the first article was written is that I believe there's a way to see these 8 modes as a system that is MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) system that accounts for each corner of life's messiness at a certain level of resolution. Inspired by Venkatesh Rao's epic post about life rule systems titled [Make Your Own Rules](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/){:target="blank"}, I've adapted his "mind-wanderer's map", complete with animal mneumonic markers, along with a few other things that feel relevant in a weird way.
