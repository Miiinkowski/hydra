Living like a hydra is a weird but hopefully useful way of approaching our lives in the spirit of growth and meaningfulness. The seed for it comes from this (most likely misattributed) quote from Viktor Frankl:

> Between stimulus and response is a space.
> 
> In that space is our power to choose our response.
> 
> In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

To live like a hydra is to practice being wholehearted and in flow in that little space between stimulus and response. It's about accepting whatever constraints we're working with in the moment -- whether it be attention, time, energy level, access to support, the lack of these things, or a mix of things. 

I wrote [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89?source=friends_link&sk=9aa3e637cb424bfe3a775a47ab740150){:target="blank"} seven years ago and have returned to it frequently enough (chaotic times are here to stay, apparently) to want to update it with an updated set of "modes" or "hydra heads" to wear in the world as we continue to run into the Chaos Monkey's antics. The Chaos Monkey represents the universe's irreducible element of rascality that lobs an unending supply of unwelcome bananas onto our path, tripping us up. Instead of battling the Chaos Monkey (which is futile), living like a hydra is about slowly learning to love the wily Chaos Monkey's rascality. Each time we find ourselves in the space between stimulus and response, processing something that feels off about the world or about ourselves, we can use that dissonance as an opportunity to grow wiser, more courageous, and more loving as the chaos monkey's lifelong dance partner.  

## 3 ways to make contact with reality

When it comes to making sense of our lives and the world we live in, there are three broad realms that a meaningful life requires contact with:  

1. **The Center - Connection to our Self:** When we feel in touch with our own intuitions and feelings and our heart and home base, we feel like we are _accepted and safe_. When we're don't feel connected to our true selves, we feel extremely _anxious and uncentered_. 
	- ❤️ The realm of the heart and personal experience.
	- 👀 Connection to Ourself is about finding the center of our own internal world via the experience of sensing and being. 
	- 🔮 Its tools are story-telling, mindfulness, intuition, beliefs, and values. 
	- 🐀 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Home, also known as Ratspace because no matter how well you know your own home, rats probably know it better. 
	- 🎈 We will also represent it with the color Red. 

2. **The Grid - Connection to our Network:** Connection to other people in the world like us. When we feel in connection with the public social realm, we feel like we are _useful and seen_. When we're don't feel connected to our community, we feel _alienated and invisible_. 
	- ✋ The realm of the hands and useful pragmatism.
	- 💬 Connection to Community is about noticing the interplay dynamics between everything, working within the messiness of communication, feedback loops, and the multiple-order effects. It's about doing things and then seeing what happens.  
	- 🌱 Its tools are relationships, social contracts, cultural norms, and expectations.
	- 🐦 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Public, also known as Crowspace because the crow can fly from your windowsill to any other windowsill in your community disregarding all the social friction we must deal with.	
	- 🌿 We will also represent it with the color Green.

3. **The Frontier - Connection to the World:** Connection to the world outside ourselves. When we feel in connection with the frontier of the world, the edge of what we consider relevant to us, we feel _certainty_ about reality. When we don't feel connected to edge of the world, or lose track of what's real or not real, we wander around feeling like nothing makes sense and borders on the _absurd_. 
	- 🧠 The realm of the head and reliable information.
	- 🌎 Connection to the World is about extending our map of the known universe and making more of it feel relevant to us.
	- 📓 Its tools are science, and data, and measuring devices, and log books, and experiments. 
	- 🐐 In Venkatesh's model, this is the Frontier, also known as Goatspace because you can find goats improbably climbing sheer cliffs at the frontiers. 
	- 💎 We will also represent it with the color Blue.

These 3 ways of making contact with reality appear in many different places within our culture and past cultural traditions. I've included a bunch of different metaphors in each bucket, since they appear slightly differently in many different contexts. If it helps, you can think of them in the same way that you think about the directions of the compass -- they point towards a certain realm of our experience of reality that can be referenced from wherever we are within that experience. They aren't places you go so much as maps that live on top of reality wherever you are in it. You'll probably discover many other facets of these 3 realms as you get to know them, feel free to associate your own preferred metaphors for them. One that I've enjoyed thinking about recently is the game of Rock Paper Scissors. I think Yellow is Rock, Red is Paper, and Blue is Scissors, but open to other interpretations.

Our relationship to the 3 realms is what determines which "mode" we're in.
 
## 8 modes 

We go in and out of contact with the three dimensions of the World, Ourselves, and Community. Our "mode" of existence can be understood by how close we feel to each of these dimensions at any given time. Sometimes we're connected to all three dimensions, and in flow. Other times we're only connected to two out of three, or one out of three. And sometimes we're out of touch with all three dimensions. All told, there are 8 high-level modes that result from this interplay of connections. Keep in mind that it's more of a spectrum than a color wheel, but the color wheel can at least identify some of the biggest landmarks along the spectrum. They are color-coded to map back to the 3 dimensions that they are in relation to: 

1. Opaque (Cat Mode)
2. Blue (Novelty Mode)
3. Green (Make It Happen Mode)
4. Red (Self Mode)
5. Cyan (Reality-Seeking Mode)
6. Magenta (Creation Mode)
7. Yellow (Relating Mode)
8. Clear (Flow Mode)

### Quick test. Which mode are you in right now?

You can quickly figure out which mode you're in right now by asking yourself these three Y/N questions.

**3 questions:** In this moment, does A or B feel more true:

1. I am A) in touch with my intuitions and authentic self B) out-of-touch and uncentered with my intuitions and authentic self
2. I feel A) useful and appreciated by my community B) alienated and invisible to my community.
3. The world outside my community feels: A) grounded and reliable B) disorganized and absurd

**Answer key:** A and B represent answers to the 3 questions above. 
>   
> BBB = Gray. AAA = Clear.  
> ABB = Red. BAB = Green. BBA = Blue.  
> AAB = Yellow. BAA = Cyan. ABA = Magenta. 

### What does each mode feel like?

1. **Opaque (Cat Mode):** This is the mode where we are burned out, tired, over-stimulated, under-nourished, and basically useless in terms of being productive. It's a time to get back to basics, and to put everything else aside so you can focus on yourself for a bit. All 3 connections (Self, Network, World) are offline for us.  We feel like the outside world doesn't make sense, we feel uncentered in our own identity, and mostly invisible to our social safety nets. The goal of this mode is to get any one of the dimensions back online, usually by focusing on the basics. Trying to be productive is pointless -- productivity happens in other modes. When in this mode, our work must focus on moving out of this mode, slowly, patiently, without beating yourself up. 

	- How to be in this mode: Channel the all-in "do nothing" mode that a cat napping on a window sill is able to do. Entire days can be written off. Rest and recovery will only happen when we stop thinking of the world as a place to get shit done. Is there anything preventing you from reverting to full-on Cat Mode? Most likely the circumstances that landed you here didn't just magically disappear, so this is completely natural. Is there any wiggle room to sneak in some serious self-care?  

	- Re-connecting with our Self: Attend to what your body is telling you it needs. Sleep, water, vegetables, exercise, stretching, meditation, etc.

	- Re-connecting with our Network: Catch up with an old friend, call up your best friend, write someone a letter, have a good conversation about nothing in particular, entertain yourself with a guilty pleasure.

	- Re-connecting with the World: If it's a nice day, get out into the world. Take a walk. Witness nature unfolding however it's doing that. Listen to a book or watch a movie. Get lost in the world to remember how much bigger it is than the things happening in your head. 

1. **Red (Self Mode):** Self-reflecting and identifying beliefs and values. Connection with our Self is online, but connections with our Network and the World are offline. This mode is all about making sure that you know what your needs are, and are able to take the steps to make sure that they’re met. This mode requires that we at least have the basics of our physical and mental needs covered (sleep, nutrition, exercise). You have the energy and opportunity to think about your values and beliefs, think about your interests and important people, and make decisions that are in your best long-term interest even if they’re difficult in the short term. Get your own head screwed on right.

	- Re-connecting with your Network in order to move to Yellow: 

	- Re-connecting with the World in order to move to Cyan:  

2. **Green (Make It Happen Mode):** Immersing yourself in busy work. The Yellow dimension is online, but Blue and Red are offline. This mode is all about connecting deeply with your community. It requires the same energy level as Blue's Novelty Mode but is handy when there’s a big backlog of things that need to get done that have been weighing on you. Things that don’t require much creativity or thought to do, but which just need to be banged out. Fixing things, cleaning things, maintaining things, organizing things, etc. When done in the right mode, this kind of slogging work can actually be very satisfying.

	- How to be in this mode: 

	- Integrating some Red in order to move to Yellow: 

	- Integrating some Blue in order to move to Cyan:  

3. **Blue (Novelty Mode):** Appreciating novelty, exploration, and stimulus. The Blue dimension is online, but Red and Yellow are offline. This mode is all about connecting with the outside world. It has a slightly higher energy level than Gray's Cat Mode but not quite enough energy to focus on a specific task. The key here is to channel the desire for distraction into seeking novelty. Meeting new people, trying new restaurants, going new places, learning about something new. It’s also a great place to think about the people that are important to you, reaching out to important people that you haven’t connected with in a while, restarting hobbies that have fallen by the wayside, and revisiting things that you don’t like to see if maybe there’s something new there that changes things. The way out of this mode is to consider Green's Reality-Seeking Mode if you are able to bring Yellow back online by establishing contact with community or Purple's Creation Mode if you are able to bring Red back online by establishing contact with yourself. If neither of those is possible, it may be necessary to step back into Gray's Cat Mode to shore up some new energy.

5. **Cyan (Reality-Seeking Mode):** Discovering something new and important about reality. The Blue and Yellow dimensions are online, but Red is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with the world and with the community.

7. **Yellow (Relating Mode):** Cultivating authentic, quality time with others. The Yellow and Red dimensions are online, but Blue is offline. This mode takes advantage of healthy connections with yourself and with the community. Quality time with people you love is probably the most rewarding experience we can have on this planet. The list is short of people that fit this category, and these are the people that are most easy to take for granted. Also, some relationships might need repair or re-connection before quality time is possible. Being in this mode is all about doing the work that sets you up for quality time, and making sure you have a chance to connect in a real way with the people that mean the most to you, as often as possible, while we can. Life is long, but not forever long.

	- When moving up from Purple to Gold: 

	- When moving up from Orange to Gold:

An important thing to remember is that none of these heads or modes are better than the others. They are each adapted to help us thrive within a certain flavor of chaos, require different levels of energy and support, and are vulnerable different kinds of chaos. A way to think about them that is new since the first article was written is that I believe there's a way to see these 8 modes as a system that is MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) system that accounts for each corner of life's messiness at a certain level of resolution. Inspired by Venkatesh Rao's epic post about life rule systems titled [Make Your Own Rules](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/){:target="blank"}, I've adapted his "mind-wanderer's map", complete with animal mneumonic markers, along with a few other things that feel relevant in a weird way.
